- For modifying and deploying to the domain:
    - I should be at the branch demo [nothing should be commited to git]
    - Modify the code I want 
        - then run [npm run build]
        - then If I want a stage before production (netlify deploy) and check draft 
        - if everything is fine => netlify deploy --prod
====================================================
- For local development and DB:
    - Just change the connection string in the secrets
